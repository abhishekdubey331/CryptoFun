CryptoFun is a Learning Project ðŸ“± for Applying Android Architecture Components with exploring <b>Jetpack Compose</b>, <b>MVVM</b>, <b>Kotlin Coroutines</b>, <b>Kotlin Flows</b> using <b>Clean Architecture</b> approach.


### Implemented by Clean Architecture
The following diagram shows the structure of this project with 3 layers:
- Presentation
- Domain
- Data


## Libraries Used :books:
* [Compose][0] Toolkit for building native UI (in a declarative way - 100% Kotlin).
* [Coroutines][1] Library support for Kotlin coroutines.
* [Flows][2] Stream processing API, built on top of Coroutines.
* [Compose Navigation][3] for tabs navigation using Jetpack Compose.
* [Dagger Hilt][4] Dependency injection library for Android.
* [Retrofit][5] Type-safe REST client for Android to consume RESTful web services.

### Communication between layers

1. UI calls method from ViewModel.
2. ViewModel executes Use case.
3. Use case gets data from Coin Repository.
4. Each Repository returns data from a Data Source.
5. Information flows back to the UI where we display the list of all coins.
6. User can click a coin to get open coin detail screen.

### API's Used
Get coins route:
https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/coins

Get a coin by ID route:
https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/coins/{coinId}
